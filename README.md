# Garden Gatherers Frontend

## Basic Overview

This is the frontend code for a web app I created called Garden Gatherers. You can see the deployed web app [here](https://gardengatherers.netlify.app/). This backend code is deployed and can be found [here](https://gardengatherers.heroku.com/categories), and the repo for the backend code can be found [here](https://github.com/laurakeeley/garden-gatherers-backend).

Garden Gatherers is a web app to bring local gardeners together instead of using paper and word-of-mouth. Users of this web app can create blog-style posts under different categories while also leaving comments and questions on posts to learn and interact. There is also a page to find meetups of local gardeners to get together and learn from one another.
